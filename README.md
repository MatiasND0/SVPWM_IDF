## Serial live plotter

This repo includes a small Python tool to visualize Angle and Velocity from your ESP-IDF serial logs in real time.

Example expected log line format:

```
I (99134) MOTOR_FOC_TORQUE: Angle: 3.14 rad, Velocity: 0.69 rad/s
```

### Setup

Install dependencies (Python 3.9+ recommended):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run

GUI plot (matplotlib):

```
python3 serial_plot.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200
```

Headless (no GUI), print parsed values:

```
python3 serial_plot.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --baud 115200 --no-gui --show-ts
```

Tips:
- Ensure your user has permissions for the serial device (e.g., add to `dialout` group on Linux or use `sudo`).
- Adjust `--port` to match your device (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB1`, `/dev/ttyACM0`).
- The plot shows a rolling window; use `--max-points` to change buffer length.

# Hello World Example

Starts a FreeRTOS task to print "Hello World".

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

## How to use example

Follow detailed instructions provided specifically for this example.

Select the instructions depending on Espressif chip installed on your development board:

- [ESP32 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/get-started/index.html)
- [ESP32-S2 Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/get-started/index.html)


## Example folder contents

The project **hello_world** contains one source file in C language [hello_world_main.c](main/hello_world_main.c). The file is located in folder [main](main).

ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt` files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets (executable, library, or both).

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.

```
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── pytest_hello_world.py      Python script used for automated testing
├── main
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── hello_world_main.c
└── README.md                  This is the file you are currently reading
```

For more information on structure and contents of ESP-IDF projects, please refer to Section [Build System](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html) of the ESP-IDF Programming Guide.

## Troubleshooting

* Program upload failure

    * Hardware connection is not correct: run `idf.py -p PORT monitor`, and reboot your board to see if there are any output logs.
    * The baud rate for downloading is too high: lower your baud rate in the `menuconfig` menu, and try again.

## Technical support and feedback

Please use the following feedback channels:

* For technical queries, go to the [esp32.com](https://esp32.com/) forum
* For a feature request or bug report, create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues)

We will get back to you as soon as possible.
